Description:
This file manages antique car data using Binary Search Tree (BST) and Hash Table data structures. It handles file operations, user input, and various functionalities like adding, deleting, and searching cars. Additional features include undoing deletions, displaying data structures, and saving to files. Integrates modules for comprehensive data management.

PROGRAMMER - BEN KATZIR
    Contribution: 
    I initialized the project by creating the original replit
    with our boiler plate main code. I created our first versions
    of the following functions which only worked with BST:
        loadCarsFromFile
        displayMenu
        addNewCar
        deleteCar
        inOrderTraversal
        displayIndentedTree

    Later I worked with the rest of the team to help integrate 
    these with the rest of the units as well as helping debug searchManager
    before our presentation on Thursday

    When we reached our mostly final version of our project I went over all the requirements
    and made sure to redesign the menu adding options F, DIS and H.

    After recieving feedback on Thursday I made sure to add menu options INS to insert
    from file, modify addNewCar to not allow duplicate items, and to automatically 
    save to file when exiting the program

Unit 1: Team Coordination

I was responsible for team coordination, data structure design, menus, and other related functions in main and integration.
I created the design of the data structures and coordinated them with the project. Furthermore, I created menus and related functions in the main. I coordinated the team for weekly reports and reminded them of the deadlines. After everyone did their own part, I ensured all parts of our project fit together smoothly, and I arranged and tested everything thoroughly. I corrected every missing part of the code, such as adding comment lines at the top of the functions that describe their purpose. I submitted each week's report, presentation poster, and presentations. I gave feedback to my team members, and I helped them solve their coding problems.

/* Contribution: Kristine Koo
I created the antiqueCar class file with the variables and setter/getter functions. 

I worked on the searchManager function, displayManager function, and
undoDelete function.

Before the project was presented, I detected an issue with the binary search
tree. Due to the input order, our BST was displaying as if the tree was a 
linked list, so I came up with the idea to scramble the data.

I helped the hash table unit by informing the team member what was wrong with
the way that the hash function was implemented, and how they could relocate it
to the proper location.

I integrated 3 of my features into main: 
1. Search manager
2. Undo delete
3. Display manager

UNIT 5: FILE I/O

I was primarily responsible for implementing the save to file feature, as well as finalizing the hash table class.

Since file output relied on the hash table methods, I worked with Kelvin to improve
the hash table class and integrate it with methods in main, one of which being calculating hash size. 

Functions hashSize, countLines, nextPrime and isPrime were used corehently to calculate hash size. Count the lines in the file, multiply by 2, find the next prime number then use hashSize to save it into a variable which can be used to create hash objects.

saveHashTableToFile (in hashtable.h) relied on the hash table methods to save data from input files into an output file in hash table sequence. It was the most challenging to implement, and required  overloading the ostream operator.

A rehash method was created if the load factor was greater than 75%, it is used in the hash insert function within an if statement.

/*  Kelvin Prabhu
    I wrote the insert, delete, search, the hash function, and all other class method in Hashtable.h except for isPrime, reHash, nextPrime. I also did the entire hashnode.h. I added in the hash table unit into the main functions search manager, undo delete, loadCarsFromFile, addNewCar, deleteCarbut. I realized that I had some errors regarding what the hashtable methods took in. With a some feedback I was able to correct these issues. I also created the viewing hash statistics function in main and the corresponding methods in the hashtable.h file.    */
